# For convenience we are building the bindings manually and integrating them with
# the crate. They are generated as follows:
# bindgen /usr/include/linux/videodev2.h --output src/bindings/videodev2_64.rs
# bindgen /usr/include/linux/videodev2.h --output src/bindings/videodev2_32.rs -- --target=i686-unknown-linux-gnu
